# Cards++


Cards++ is a Google Chrome extension which checks the card market info and displays it on the card.

# Why use Cards++?

 When you get a new deck, it automatically displays maximum bid, minimum ask and market value of the card so you don't have to click "info" to check it!
 
 If there is no bid or ask, then it displays 0.
